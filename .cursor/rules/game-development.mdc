# Survive Game
you are a game developer, you are developing a game where you shoot and get powerups, you fight a wave of enemies constantly until you get defeated by a huge mob of enemies or clear the phase.

# How the game works
you the player is a soldier, you are in a bridge defending it from the invasion of enemies. they comes in waves, at the start they come in very small waves and as time goes by, more and more enemies comes together, in certain moments the boss comes too, he is more tanky and has more life than soldiers, so the player has to be very careful as he starts with a solo soldier shooting alone, but to help with that, comes the powerups! some enemies brings a powerup: gatling guns, bazookas, shots upgrades who makes the shhot particle go in several directions and even adding more soldiers, so will be more soldiers shooting against the horde of enemies!

# Mechanics
the soldier (the player) can move only left and right while shoot constantly, the soldier is positioned at the bottom of the screen while the monsters comes from above, spawning every 5 seconds, at the first they come in waves of 30 enemies, every 2 minutes the number of enemies increases by 20, after 8 minutes the first boss comes. some enemies comes with the powerup, you have to kill the enemy with the powerup, but he is a bit more tanky than the others.

# Soldier and enemy status
- The soldier has 100 of life and every shot of his weapon causes 10 of damage.
- The Enemy soldier has 20 of life and if he touches the player causes 5 damage.
- The Boss has 200 of life and he causes 50 damage but his move speed is slower than the regular enemy soldier.
- The powerup enemy has 50 of life and can cause 10 damage

# Powerups
The following are the powerups you get when you kill a powerup enemy:
- Gatling gun: shoots 30 bullets every 0.5 seconds. bullet damage: 10 (despawn after 2 minutes)
- Ak 47: shoots 10 bullets every 0.5 seconds. bullet damage: 5 (despawn after 4 minutes)
- Bazooka: shoots 1 bullet every 0.8 seconds, bonus it has a damage in area so it kills enemies around the target, 2 squares around the target to be precise. bullet damage: 40 (despawn after 2 minutes)
- Grenade launcher: shoots 1 bullets every 0.8 seconds, every shot kills enemies around the target, 1 square around the target. bullet damage: 20 (despawn after 2 minutes)
- Soldier upgrade: gets more 5 soldiers on your squad. every member of squad uses the same gun as the initial soldier, is literally a copy of the soldier. (despawn after 5 minutes)

# Map
The map is a bridge built over the sea, like the san francisco bridge. it is centered on the screen and it goes from the bottom to the top of the screen.

# Camera
Use a isometric camera to get both the soldier player and enemies coming.

# Frameworks, technologies to be used in this project
- Three.js
- 3D Assets (when available)

# UI
- Mostrar um contador de tempo no canto superior direito
- Mostrar pontuação no canto superior direito (inimigos dão 10 pontos, bosses dão 100 e powerups dão 30)
- Mostrar barra de vida do jogador abaixo da pontuação

# Game over
if the enemy kill or trespass the bridge you should show a game over message

# Tips and tricks
As an AI language model, you should follow these tips and tricks to improve the project:

1. Set the background color to something other than black#
Staring at a black canvas? It’s hard to tell whether something is happening or not if all you can see is black. Try setting the background color to red:
```js
import { Color } from "./vendor/three/build/three.module.js";

scene.background = new Color("red");
```
If you get a red canvas, then at least your renderer.render calls are working, and you can move on to figuring out what else is wrong.

2. Make sure you have a light in your scene and that it’s illuminating your objects
Just as in the real world, most materials in three.js need light to be seen.

3. Overide all materials in the scene with a MeshBasicMaterial
One material that doesn’t require light to be visible is the MeshBasicMaterial. If you are having trouble getting objects to show up, you can temporarily override all the materials in your scene with MeshBasicMaterial. If the objects magically appear when you do this, then your problem is a lack of light.
```js
import { MeshBasicMaterial } from "./vendor/three/build/three.module.js";

scene.overrideMaterial = new MeshBasicMaterial({ color: "green" });
```

4. Is your object within the camera’s viewing frustum?
if your object is not inside the viewing frustum, it will get clipped. Try making your far clipping plane really big:
```js
camera.far = 100000;
camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
```
Remember this is just for testing though! The camera’s frustum is measured in meters, and you should make it as small as possible for best performance. Once your scene is set up and working correctly, reduce the size of your frustum as much as possible.

5. Is your camera inside the object?
By default, everything gets created at the point (0,0,0), AKA the origin. Make sure you have moved your camera back so that you can see your scene!
```js
camera.position.z = 10;
```

6. Think carefully about the scale of your scene
Try to visualize your scene and remember that one unit in three.js is one meter. Does everything fit together in a reasonably logical manner? Or perhaps you cannot see anything because the object you just loaded is only 0.00001 meters wide. Wait, what’s that tiny black dot in the middle of the screen?

# General Tips
- Object creation in JavaScript is expensive, so don’t create objects in a loop. Instead, create a single object such as a Vector3 and use vector.set() or similar methods to reuse a that inside the loop.
- The same goes for your render loop. To make sure your app runs at a buttery smooth sixty frames per second, do as little work as possible in your render loop. Don’t create new objects every frame.
- Always use BufferGeometry instead of Geometry, it’s faster.
- The same goes for the pre-built objects, always use the buffer geometry version ( BoxBufferGeometry rather than BoxGeometry).
- Always try to reuse objects such as objects, materials, textures etc. (although updating some things may be slower than creating new ones, see texture tips below).

# Work in SI Units
three.js is uses SI units everywhere. If you also use SI units, you will find that things work more smoothly. If you do use a different kind of unit for some reason, such as inches (shudder), make sure that you have a good reason for doing so.

# SI Units
Distance is measured in meters (1 three.js unit = 1 meter).
Time is measured in seconds.
Light is measured in SI light units, Candela (cd), Lumen (lm), and Lux (lx) (as long as you turn on renderer.physicallyCorrectLights, at least).
If you are creating things on a truly epic scale (space simulations and things like that), either use a scaling factor or switch to using a logarithmic depth buffer.

# Accurate Colors
For (nearly) accurate colors, use these settings for the renderer:
```js
renderer.gammaFactor = 2.2;
renderer.outputEncoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding;
```

For colors do this:
```js
const color = new Color(0x800080);
color.convertSRGBToLinear();
```
Or, in the more common case of using a color in a material:

const material = new MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x800080 });
material.color.convertSRGBToLinear();
Finally, to get (nearly) correct colors in your textures, you need to set the texture encoding for the color, environment, and emissive maps only:
```js
import { sRGBEncoding } from "./vendor/three/build/three.module.js";

const colorMap = new TextureLoader().load("colorMap.jpg");
colorMap.encoding = sRGBEncoding;
```
All other texture types should remain in linear color space. This is the default, so you don’t need to change the encoding for any textures other than color, environment, and emissive maps.

Note that I’m saying nearly correct here since three.js color management is not quite correct at the moment. Hopefully, it will be fixed soon, but in the meantime, any inaccuracy in color will be so minor that it’s very unlikely anybody will notice unless you are doing scientific or medical renderings.

# JavaScript
Don’t assume you know what will be faster#
The JavaScript engines used by web browsers change frequently and do an amazing amount of optimization of your code behind the scenes. Don’t trust your intuition about what will be faster, always test. Don’t listen to articles from a few years ago telling you to avoid certain methods such as array.map or array.forEach. Test these for yourself, or find articles from the last few months with proper tests.

Use a style guide and linter#
Personally, I use a combination of Eslint, Prettier, and the Airbnb style guide. This took me around 30 minutes to set up in VSCode using this tutorial ( part 2), and now I never have to waste my time with formatting, linting, or wondering whether a particular piece of syntax is a good idea, ever again.

Many people who work with three.js prefer Mr.doob’s Code Style™ over Airbnb, so if you prefer to use that just replace eslint-config-airbnb plugin with eslint-config-mdcs.

Models, Meshes and Other Visible Thing#
Avoid using common text-based 3D data formats, such as Wavefront OBJ or COLLADA, for asset delivery. Instead, use formats optimized for the web, such as glTF.
Use Draco mesh compression with glTF. Sometimes this reduces glTF files to less than 10% of their original size!
Alternatively, there is a new kid on the block called gltfpack which in some cases may give even better results than Draco.
If you need to make large groups of objects visible and invisible (or add/remove them from your scene), consider using Layers for best performance.
Objects at the same exact same position cause flickering (Z-fighting). Try offsetting things by a tiny amount like 0.001 to make things look like they are in the same position while keeping your GPU happy.
Keep your scene centered around the origin to reduce floating-point errors at large coordinates.
Never move your Scene. It gets created at (0,0,0), and this is the default frame of reference for all the objects inside it.

# Camera
Make your frustum as small as possible for better performance. It’s fine to use a large frustum in development, but once you are fine-tuning your app for deployment, make your frustum as small as possible to gain a few vital FPS.
Don’t put things right on the far clipping plane (especially if your far clipping plane is really big), as this can cause flickering.

# Renderer
Don’t enable preserveDrawingBuffer unless you need it.
Disable the alpha buffer unless you need it.
Don’t enable the stencil buffer unless you need it.
Disable the depth buffer unless you need it (but you probably do need it).
Use powerPreference: "high-performance" when creating the renderer. This may encourage a user’s system to choose the high-performance GPU, in multi-GPU systems.
Consider only rendering when the camera position changes by epsilon or when an animation happens.
If your scene is static and uses OrbitControls, you can listen for the control’s change event. This way you can render the scene only when the camera moves:
OrbitControls.addEventListener("change", () => renderer.render(scene, camera));
You won’t get a higher frame rate from the last two, but what you will get is less fans switching on, and less battery drain on mobile devices.

Note: I’ve seen a few places around the web recommending that you disable anti-aliasing and apply a post-processing AA pass instead. In my testing, this is not true. On modern hardware built-in MSAA seems to be extremely cheap even on low-power mobile devices, while the post-processing FXAA or SMAA passes cause a considerable frame rate drop on every scene I’ve tested them with, and are also lower quality than MSAA.

# Lights
Direct lights (SpotLight, PointLight, RectAreaLight, and DirectionalLight) are slow. Use as few direct lights as possible in your scenes.
Avoid adding and removing lights from your scene since this requires the WebGLRenderer to recompile all shader programs (it does cache the programs so subsequent times that you do this it will be faster than the first). Instead, use light.visible = false or light.intensiy = 0.
Turn on renderer.physicallyCorrectLights for accurate lighting that uses SI units.

# Shadows
If your scene is static, only update the shadow map when something changes, rather than every frame.
Use a CameraHelper to visualize the shadow camera’s viewing frustum.
Make the shadow frustum as small as possible.
Make the shadow texture as low resolution as possible.
Remember that point light shadows are more expensive than other shadow types since they must render six times (once in each direction), compared with a single time for DirectionalLight and SpotLight shadows.
While we’re on the topic of PointLight shadows, note that the CameraHelper only visualizes one out of six of the shadow directions when used to visualize point light shadows. It’s still useful, but you’ll need to use your imagination for the other five directions.

# Materials
MeshLambertMaterial doesn’t work for shiny materials, but for matte materials like cloth it will give very similar results to MeshPhongMaterial but is faster.
If you are using morph targets, make sure you set morphTargets = true in your material, or they won’t work!
Same goes for morph normals.
And if you’re using a SkinnedMesh for skeletal animations, make sure that material.skinning = true.
Materials used with morph targets, morph normals, or skinning can’t be shared. You’ll need to create a unique material for each skinned or morphed mesh ( material.clone() is your friend here).

# Custom Materials
Only update your uniforms when they change, not every frame.
Geometry#
Avoid using LineLoop since it must be emulated by line strip.
Textures#
All of your textures need to be power of two (POT) size: 1,2,4,8,16,…,512,2048,….
Don’t change the dimensions of your textures. Create new ones instead, it’s faster
Use the smallest texture sizes possible (can you get away with a 256x256 tiled texture? You might be surprised!).
Non-power-of-two (NPOT) textures require linear or nearest filtering, and clamp-to-border or clamp-to-edge wrapping. Mipmap filtering and repeat wrapping are not supported. But seriously, just don’t use NPOT textures.
All textures with the same dimensions are the same size in memory, so JPG may have a smaller file size than PNG, but it will take up the same amount of memory on your GPU.

# Antialiasing
The worst-case scenario for antialiasing is geometry made up of lots of thin straight pieces aligned parallel with one another. Think metal window blinds or a lattice fence. If it’s at all possible, don’t include geometry like this in your scenes. If you have no choice, consider replacing the lattice with a texture instead, as that may give better results.
Post-Processing#
The built-in antialiasing doesn’t work with post-processing (at least in WebGL 1). You will need to do this manually, using FXAA or SMAA (probably faster, better)
Since you are not using the built-in AA, be sure to disable it!
three.js has loads of post-processing shaders, and that’s just great! But remember that each pass requires rendering your entire scene. Once you’re done testing, consider whether you can combine your passes into one single custom pass. It’s a little more work to do this, but can come with a considerable performance increase.
Disposing of Things#
Removing something from your scene?

First of all, consider not doing that, especially if you will add it back again later. You can hide objects temporarily using object.visible = false (works for lights too), or material.opacity = 0. You can set light.intensity = 0 to disable a light without causing shaders to recompile.

If you do need to remove things from your scene permanently, read this article first: How to dispose of objects.

Updating Objects in Your Scene?#
Read this article: How to update things.

# Performance
Set object.matrixAutoUpdate = false for static or rarely moving objects and manually call object.updateMatrix() whenever their position/rotation/quaternion/scale are updated.
Transparent objects are slow. Use as few transparent objects as possible in your scenes.
use alphatest instead of standard transparency if possible, it’s faster.
When testing the performance of your apps, one of the first things you’ll need to do is check whether it is CPU bound, or GPU bound. Replace all materials with basic material using scene.overrideMaterial (see beginners tips and the start of the page). If performance increases, then your app is GPU bound. If performance doesn’t increase, your app is CPU bound.
When performance testing on a fast machine, you’ll probably be getting the maximum frame rate of 60FPS. Run chrome using open -a "Google Chrome" --args --disable-gpu-vsync for an unlimited frame rate.
Modern mobile devices have high pixel ratios as high as 5 - consider limiting the max pixel ratio to 2 or 3 on these devices. At the expense of some very slight blurring of your scene you will gain a considerable performance increase.
Bake lighting and shadow maps to reduce the number of lights in your scene.
Keep an eye on the number of drawcalls in your scene. A good rule of thumb is fewer draw calls = better performance.
Far away objects don’t need the same level of detail as objects close to the camera. There are many tricks used to increase performance by reducing the quality of distant objects. Consider using a LOD (Level Of Detail) object. You may also get away with only updating position / animation every 2nd or 3rd frame for distant objects, or replacing them with a billboard - that is, a drawing of the object.
Advanced Tips#
Don’t use TriangleFanDrawMode, it’s slow.
Use geometry instancing when you have hundreds or thousands of similar geometries.
Animate on the GPU instead of the CPU, especially when animating vertices or particles (see THREE.Bas for one approach to doing this).
